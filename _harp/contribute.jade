  * ## Beta Tester:
    * As a beta tester, you would simply download the app/visit the website that we develop, and test the features and give us feedback as to what is not working, what could be improved, and what you liked.
    * We will send out emails when we are in need of beta testers, so until then, you can [request info](/#request) in order to be on our list.
  * ## Ambassador
    * As an ambassador, you would approach your school, proposing the usage of openSourceSchool's software, as well as modify and maintain the software for your school.
    * We will be sending out applications for ambassadorship once we are done with development, so until then feel free to [request info](/#request) so that we can notify you when the time comes.

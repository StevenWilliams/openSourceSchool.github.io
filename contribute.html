<li><h2>Developer:</h2>
<ul>
<li>In order to help out with development, <a href="/#request">request info</a> and we will get back to you within a day or two with more details about the program.</li>
<li>Right now, there are two primary software components we are going to start building: a mobile app for schools, as well as a web framework/CMS for schools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h2>Beta Tester:</h2>
<ul>
<li>As a beta tester, you would simply download the app/visit the website that we develop, and test the features and give us feedback as to what is not working, what could be improved, and what you liked.</li>
<li>We will send out emails when we are in need of beta testers, so until then, you can <a href="/#request">request info</a> in order to be on our list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h2>Ambassador</h2>
<ul>
<li>As an ambassador, you would approach your school, proposing the usage of openSourceSchool&#39;s software, as well as modify and maintain the software for your school.</li>
<li>We will be sending out applications for ambassadorship once we are done with development, so until then feel free to <a href="/#request">request info</a> so that we can notify you when the time comes.</li>
</ul>
